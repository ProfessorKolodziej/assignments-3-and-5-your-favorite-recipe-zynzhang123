			<p class="introduce-to-make-it">Now, I know that making cheesecake can seem a little intimidating. It’s a
				custard dessert that requires
				careful
				baking in a water bath to prevent cracking and achieve the perfect consistency. But don’t let that daunt
				you.
				With a few pointers and a tried-and-true recipe, which I’m happy to share with you, even beginners can
				whip
				up a
				dense, rich, creamy (and crack-free) cheesecake. This is a tradition-worthy dessert that rivals the best
				NY
				delicatessens. Who knows, maybe it will even help you win over someone special!</p>

				<h2 class="necessity-title">What You’ll Need To Make A Classic New York Cheesecake</h2>
				<h3 class="ingredient-title">Ingredient</h3>
				<ul class="ingredient-content">
					<li>A buttery graham cracker crust</li>
					<li>Four 8-ounce bricks of full-fat cream cheese</li>
					<li>Three eggs</li>
					<li>Sugar</li>
					<li>One cup of our cream</li>
					<li>One teaspoon of vanilla</li>
					<li>One lemon</li>
					<li>One teaspoon of salt</li>
					<li>A few tablespoons of flour</li>
				</ul>

		</section>
		<p class="introduction-of-cream-cheese">Cream cheese is the key ingredient, so I recommend using a good
			brand,
			like Philadelphia. Moreover, flour
			might seem like an unusual addition—not all cheesecake recipes incorporate it—but it’s the secret to
			success. A little starch helps prevent the cake from cracking and also makes the filling lighter and
			fluffier.</p>

				<p>You’ll need a 9 or 10-inch <a href="https://health.amazon.com/onemedical/">springform</a> pan and
					18-inch
					heavy-duty aluminum foil. The springform pan features
					sides that can be removed from the base, so you can release the cake easily without having to flip
					the
					whole
					pan over (this would be a disaster with cheesecake). Springform pans, however, are notorious for
					leaking.
					Since the cheesecake bakes in a water bath, the foil prevents the water from seeping in during
					baking. 
				</p>
				<p>You will also need an electric mixer for whipping up the batter and a <a
